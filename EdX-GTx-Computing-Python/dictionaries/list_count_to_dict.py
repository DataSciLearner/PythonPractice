#Write a function called name_counts. name_counts will take
#as input a list of full names. Each name will be two words
#separated by a space, like "David Joyner".
#
#The function should return a dictionary. The keys to the
#dictionary will be the first names from the list, and the
#values should be the number of times that first name
#appeared.
#
#HINT: Use split() to split names into first and last.


#Add your function here!
def name_counts(lst):
     '''
     Split fullnames from the list, and populate the dictionary based on how many times the first name appears.
     '''
     outputdict = {}
     #Iterate through the list
     for item in lst:
          #split the full name
          first, last = item.split()
          #Check if first name already in dictionary, if not create key. 
          #If yes, then incremenet value by one.
          if not first in outputdict:
               outputdict[first] = 0 #Create key
          outputdict[first] += 1 #Add one each time the firstname is encountered
     return outputdict


#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print (although the order of the keys may vary):
#{'Shelba': 5, 'Maren': 1, 'Nicol': 1, 'David': 2, 'Brenton': 2}
